# üìù OurStory: A Progressive Web App for Sharing Stories

## This application is a final project developed for the "Belajar Pengembangan Web Intermediate" course at Dicoding Academy. It's a modern, installable, and offline-first Progressive Web App (PWA) for sharing and exploring stories with location data.

## ‚ú® Key Features
- Full RESTful API Integration: The app interacts with the Dicoding Story API to perform CRUD (Create, Read) operations on stories. All stories are persisted on a remote server.
- User Authentication: Includes a complete user flow with registration and login pages to manage stories securely.
- Model-View-Presenter (MVP) Architecture: The application is built using a strict MVP pattern with vanilla JavaScript, ensuring a clean separation of concerns between data (Model), display (View), and logic (Presenter).
- Progressive Web App (PWA):
   - Installable: Can be installed on desktop or mobile devices for a native-app-like experience.
   - Offline First: Utilizes a Service Worker (powered by Workbox) to cache the application shell, API responses, and images, allowing the app to be fully functional without an internet connection.
- IndexedDB for Offline Favorites: Users can save their favorite stories, which are stored locally using IndexedDB, making them accessible even when offline.
- Interactive Maps: Integrates Leaflet.js to display story locations on an interactive map with multiple layer controls (e.g., Street, Satellite).
- Device Feature Integration: Users can add new stories by uploading a file or directly capturing a photo using their device's camera.
- Modern Web Features: Implements smooth page transitions using the View Transitions API and allows users to subscribe to Push Notifications.
- Accessibility: Built with accessibility in mind, including features like a skip-to-content link and proper semantic HTML.
